## Password Generator 

* The app starts when you push the Generate Password button. 
* The first prompt requests the number of characters you would liek in your password. The requirements are set to only allow 8-128 characters. If a number outside of the parameters is entered, a new window will pop up telling you the required character limit and take you back to the start to try again. 
* The second prompt asks if you would like uppercase letters included.
* The third prompt asks if you would like to include numbers. 
* The final prompt asks if you would like to include special characters. 
* Once all prompts are completed, a password meeting the specified requirements generates in the box.
